<h3>Steps to get the flag</h3>
The first thing I did was view the permissions from the AWS EKS cluster. Then, I used the AWS Kubernetes help command. I.e., kubectl --help. 
Afterward, I typed kubectl edit secrets. I saw the flag, and it was in base64. I closed the file, used CyberChef to decode it, and got the flag.
