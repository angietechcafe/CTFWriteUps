<h2>Steps to get the flag: </h2>

After downloading the binary file, the first thing I did was look at the challenge description. The title of this challenge has the word "string" in it. I also noticed that in Linux, there is a command called strings. I used strings string_cheese and discovered that the cheese connoisseur's favorite flavor is blueberry. Finally, I connected to nc lac.tf 31131, answered the favorite cheese flavor question, and got the flag.Â
