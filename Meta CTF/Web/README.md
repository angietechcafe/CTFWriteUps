<h2>Angie's Write-up for Under Inspection (100 points)</h2>

<h3>Challenge description</h3>

<p>Someone made this<a href="https://metaproblems.com/2841e99cee26f773b26b300acad556c4/inspect/">site</a>for the Autobots to chat with each other. Seems like the Decepticons have found the site too and made accounts. One of the Autobot accounts has a flag that they're trying to keep hidden from the Decepticons, can you figure out which account it is and steal it?</p>


<h2>Steps to get the flag</h2>
<p>I right-clicked and viewed the source page of this site. Then I plugged in the username and password to get the flag.</p>
