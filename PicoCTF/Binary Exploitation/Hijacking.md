<h3>Steps to get the flag</h3>

<p>First, I used sudo -l to view my privileges on the Linux machine. In this case, I had access to a server Python file. From there, I used cat and vim on the server python file to see what was inside. In this case, there was Base64, which is highly vulnerable. I decided to comment out all of it and made a string variable, test, and another variable, test_this, to encode and decode the Base64. 
  
Next, I looked at the Python version and discovered that it was Python 3.8 and changed directories to that Python folder. I checked for different files and found a base64.py file. Based on the challenge's title, hijacking, I googled Python hijacking and discovered pty.spawn. I found the previous bin directory using sudo -l and considered using '/bin/bash' with pty. - The objective is to get root access, which brings us a standard shell, a regular root user. Finally, I used sudo /usr/bin/python3 /home/picoctf/.server.py and discovered that I officially have root access and can get the flag. I changed the directory to the challenge directory, used ls, and discovered a metadata.json file. I used ls once again and found the flag.</p>
