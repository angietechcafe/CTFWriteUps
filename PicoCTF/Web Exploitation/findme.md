<h3>Steps to get the flag</h3>

<p>
  1. After putting the credentials on the website, I clicked on the network tab from my browser's developer tools and noticed an interesting 304 HTTP request.
  2. I clicked on that specific request and discovered base64 from the window.location=" next-page" and decided to copy the link and save it for decoding Base64. 
  3. From there, I opened up Burp Suite, sent the link to the repeater, pressed forward a couple of times, and saw the first part of the flag encoded in Base64. 
  4. Lastly, I used From Base64 recipe from the CyberChef tool and pasted the entire Base64 to get the flag. </p>
