<h1> Angie's Write-up for Buckeyenotes (Beginner) </h1>

<h2>Challenge description</h2>
<p>Note taking apps are all the rage lately but turns our they're harder to make than I thought :/. Even in development buckeyenotes has gotten some traction, Brutus signed up! I think his user name is brutusB3stNut9999. I wonder what kind of notes he writes ðŸ¤” but I don't have his login...

<h3>Steps to get the flag</h3>

1. Check for the default credentials on the login page. I tried using admin brutusB3stNut9999 as the username and password as the password to login. The output was "invalid username and password". 
2. For this step, we can use a SQL injection to bypass the login screen and get the flag. The SQL injection payload that I tried for the password section was " OR 1 = 1 -- - . I also used the same username and was brought with a new message on the website. It gave me a hint that I ought to remove the equal sign from the payload and use -- - instead. 
3. After putting in ' OR 1 -- - as the password, the website gave us another clue that we are still logged in as rene. This tells us that we need to use a different SQL injection for the password in order to get the flag. After researching for vulnerable SQL clauses, I discovered that the LIMIT clause is vulnerable to SQL injections. So I slightly modified the previous payload and used 1,2 since the flag requires two records. I.e.: ' OR 1 LIMIT 1,2 -- -
4. Now we see the flag: buckeye{wr1t3_ur_0wn_0p3n_2_pwn}
