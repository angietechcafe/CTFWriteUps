<h3>Steps to get the flag</h3>
 For this challenge, I first downloaded the soda.jar file and decompiled it by using a free and online <a href="http://www.javadecompilers.com">Java decompiler</a>. I realized that my team and I had to read lots of Java in order to get this flag. In the Java code, it asked the user to buy the most expensive soda and then it would present us with the flag.
