<h1>Angie's notes on Simple Format</h1>

<h2>Problem:</h2>
<p>I seem to have forgotten my flag ... Can you guess it for me? 
  
  I get pretty forgetful of what I type so I made sure to always remind myself if I make a mistake so I don't send the same data twice.

  The service is located at host1.metaproblems.com 5470. You can use a tool like nc or netcat to access it.

  Here's the compiled binary.

  Hint: %s is a useful format indeed, but are there other ways to display data as well?</p>
  
 <h3>Steps to get the flag</h3>
 
 <p>1. Figure out what the problem is trying to ask us. In this case, this vulnerability is a string format vulnerability.
    <!---2. This is a pwn challenge. We can solve this challenge in several ways. In this case, I will use the pwn library from Python.--> </p>
